# ligature-pad

This project is a [Tauri](https://tauri.studio/) app for working with Ligature data.

## Developing

This project requires you to have the initial deps for Tauri setup. See https://tauri.studio/en/docs/getting-started/intro for instructions for your given platform.

When you first check out this repo run `npm install`

The easiest way to develop this application is to have two shells open.

In the first run `npm run dev` to start the wep app side of things.

In the other run `npm run tauri dev` to start the desktop app side of things.

This will take quite of a bit of time the first time you run things.
